  # We don't always use bundler to make for a faster boot time.
  # In this case we vendor a small number of dependencies we absolutely
  # require. Since they are vendored and 3rd party we do not impose our
  # styleguide on them but they are still in the repo.

  # Mac OS High Sierra ships with Ruby 2.3.x

# We disable this at entrypoint.
# Due to CLI apps being invoked via an entry point,

# This doesn't take into account retrying from an exception. E.g.:

# Allow the use of globals which occasionally makes sense in a CLI app
# As we are not multi-threaded and have a single entry point, this makes it easy to,
# for example, track process environments to restore at the end of invocation
Style/GlobalVars:
  Enabled: false

# Allow readable block formatting in some weird cases
# Particularly in something like:
#   Dev::Util.begin do
#     might_raise_if_costly_prep_not_done()
#   end.retry_after(ExpectedError) do
#     costly_prep()
#   end
Style/MultilineBlockChain:
  Enabled: false

# Our extensive use of blocks in our CLI apps means that it is more
# expessive and easier to read a block var name than a random yield
