\fBshadowenv\fR [\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-V\fR] \fIsubcommand\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBshadowenv\fR provides a way to perform a set of manipulations to the process environment upon entering a directory in a shell. These manipulations are reversed when leaving the directory, and there is some limited ability to make the manipulations dynamic.
